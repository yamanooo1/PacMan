# Progress documentation

### 1. Preparing the Project
    1.  Reviewing the assignment;
        I used Claude AI to gain a clearer understanding of the assignment requirements. I also consulted external
        resources such as "Refactoring Guru" and "SFML Game Development By Example" to build a solid foundational
        understanding of the concepts involved in this project. (Approx. 6 hours)
    
    2.  Setting up the development environment;
        I installed SFML, Valgrind, and configured CircleCI to ensure a proper workflow and testing environment.
        (Approx. 1 hour)
    
    3.  Planning the project structure;
        After brainstorming, I decided on the file structure for the project. For the CMakeLists file, I used
        Claude AI to help generate the necessary configuration. (Approx. 2 hours to complete the setup)
    
    4.  Creating a development roadmap;
        Before starting the implementation, I created my own roadmap outlining the development process.
        I then asked Claude AI to review it and provide feedback to ensure I started with a well-organized plan and
        minimized potential mistakes. (Approx. 2 hours)
